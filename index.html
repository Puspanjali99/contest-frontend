            including a British Academy Film Award and a CÃ©sar Award, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe 
            Award.Though most famous for her role as Isabella "Bella" Swan in The Twilight (2008) Saga, Kristen Stewart has been a working 
            actor since her early years in Los Angeles, California. Her parents, John Stewart and Jules Stewart, both work in film and 
            television. The family includes three boys, Kristen's older brother Cameron Stewart and two adopted brothers Dana and Taylor. 
            Kristen is of English, Scottish, and Ashkenazi Jewish descent. After a talent scout caught her grade school performance in a play 
            at the age of eight, she appeared on television in a few small roles. Her first significant role came when she was cast as Sam 
            Jennings in The Safety of Objects (2001). Soon after that, she starred alongside Jodie Foster in the hit drama, Panic Room (2002)
            and was nominated for a Young Artist Award. Praised for her Panic Room performance, she went on to join the cast of Cold Creek Manor
            (2003) as the daughter of Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone.Though the film did not do well at the box office, she received another 
            nomination for a Young Artist Award. After appearing in a handful of movies and a Showtime movie called Speak (2004), Stewart was 
            cast in the role of a teenage singer living in a commune in Sean Penn's Into the Wild (2007), a critically acclaimed biopic. A 
            third Young Artist Award nomination resulted in a win for this role. She also appeared in Mary Stuart Masterson's The Cake Eaters
